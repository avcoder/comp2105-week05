- Step 2 is to assign your named keyframe to a DOM element(s) by using keyword 'animation' plus more values

- All we're going to do is define the keyframes by giving it a name
- Review last week's class of transforms and transitions - make rocket move using transform/transition
- Now, let's recreate that exact thing using animation
- First step - define @keyframes (plural 's') and give it a name

# 1b) codepen

- now you want to declare the visual changes
- erase all the transform/transition code
- code Step 1
- just because I made a keyframe it won't work unless you use/assign it.
- so we just recreated it using animation -- what's the big deal? Assign break points
- code Step 2
